# DataLeadership
This presentation is a culmination of a course Data Leadership and Management, which focused on communicating solutions to data-related business problems. 
This course prepared me to think like a data leader, from communications, ethics, privacy, and 
governess, to the ability to align data ownership and usage with strategic goals of 
the business so to best lead an enterprise.

This presentation overviews a pitch for an investment from executives for a fictional company my team created - Local Bru, a regional coffee chain spanning the midwest. 
Our goal with this company was to utilize intelligent AI to obtain better control over our expenses. We addressed the challenges in analytics that our current 
company faced through an SBAR analysis (Subject, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) and defined Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). 
We planned our data governance policies and how we will monitor, manage, and anticipate our proposal. 

Through an investment of $300,000, we calculated anticipated Return and Value on Investment and provided our Net Present Value five-year plan for Local Bru to reach a bottom-line impact for our executives. Our return realization was expected in just over 1.5 years. Together, we fully described our companies’ goals and what efforts are necessary to be successful in today’s digital world.
